  "description": "This dataset contains the processed Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 features used for yield rediction  in the Yield Prediction and Estimation from Earth Observation (YIPEEO) project. Sentinel-2 L2A collection is used to compute a set of features based on the provided bands as well as various vegetation indices. Sentinel-1 data for the years 2016-2023 was pre-processed by TUW RS on the Vienna Scientific Cluster using the software SNAP8 and software packages developed by the TUW RS group.",
